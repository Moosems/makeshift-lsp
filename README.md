# Makeshift-LSP

This folder contains a makeshift LSP I am making for future code editors I make for myself so I don't have to recreate the highlighting and autocomplete code portions every time and it also allows me to narrow down my issues.

I plan to improve the LSP to use a server-client model that is displayed in the simple_example folder
